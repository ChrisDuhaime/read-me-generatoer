# Summary of Project

* On this assignment we were given some starter code and we had to finish the application.  I took the starter code plus inquirer and file system to help create a command line application that took inputs and created a README.md file in appropriate format.  

* I tried to make the application as close to the example provided in class that would utilize string literals to help design the markdown so that it is created upon completing the inquirer questions.
